# Building the DUALECHO model

The current version of the DUALECHO model is designed to build with the latest 
version of Fabber. Although it should be possible to build them against FSL 5.0 
you may need to edit the source slightly. So your first step should be to build 
[fabber_core](https://ibme-gitcvs.eng.ox.ac.uk/fabber/fabber_core) from Git. 
Build instructions for fabber_core are in the Wiki on its Git page. 

You will make the process straightforward if you create a directory (e.g. 
'fabber') and download the Git repositories for fabber_core and fabber_models_dualecho
into this directory. Then the model build should be able to find the Fabber 
libraries without you having to install them or tell the build scripts where 
they are.

### Building in a standard FSL environment

The process should be:

    source $FSLDIR/etc/fslconf/fsl-devel.sh
    make

This will produce an executable `fabber_dualecho`.

### Building with non-standard FSL

In this case we can use the cross-platform `cmake` system. Convenience scripts
are provided, so the build should be:

    scripts/build.sh relwithdebinfo
    
This creates a release build (fully optimized) but including debugging symbols
so crashes can be traced. The output is in the `build_relwithdebinfo` directory
and will include the executable `fabber_dualecho` as well as a shared library
(e.g. `libfabber_models_dualecho.so` on Linux)

#### It failed with something about `recompile with -fPIC`

Short answer: if you were using the `cmake` build method, try the `standard
FSL environment` method.

You can also go into the build directory and just build the executable:

    cd build_relwithdebinfo
    make fabber_dualecho
    
Long answer: In order to build the shared library, the FSL libraries have to 
contain 'Position-independent code'. If they don't you can't build the library 
and will need to use the fabber_dualecho executable instead. The only way around 
this is to recompile the FSL libraries with the -fPIC flag which you can
do using the CMake-enabled code [here](https://ibme-gitcvs.eng.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fsl).
It's not worth doing this unless you really need the shared library.

## Successful build?

You can verify that the DUALECHO model is available whichever method you choose:

    fabber_dualecho --listmodels

    dualecho
    linear
    poly
    trivial

or if you used cmake and built the shared library, you can also do:

    fabber --loadmodels=libfabber_models_dualecho.so --listmodels
    
    dualecho
    linear
    poly
    trivial
  
Note that you still need to specify --model=dualecho on the command line to tell 
Fabber to use the DUALECHO model.
